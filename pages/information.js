      <h3>What is FOOTPRINTZ?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Footprintz is a <span>school project app</span> developed for Advice. We are two students form KEA Multimedia Front-end line, Anna & Emma.
          The goal of footprints is to <span>spread awareness</span> about your carbon footprint and how much your online habits can
          <span> affect the world</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want this app to be used as a <span>conversation starter</span> and a <span>self consciousness tool</span>. This app is developed in hope
          for it to be used in highschools to help <span>new generations</span> getting awareness about their daily online habits and help them build{" "}
          healthy and <span>green online habits</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here you can <span>test how much carbon you emit</span> with your daily habits and get some tips on how to be better, or even on how to
          start being green üíö

      <h3>WHY THIS VISUAL STYLE?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Did you know that bright colours emits more CO2 than <span>dark colours</span> ? And that blue emits 25% more than green or red ? Did you
          also know that
          <span> system fonts</span> (the ones already built in you PCs) are much more <span>sustainable</span> than fancy and downloadable fonts are?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we have chosen these dark colours with some light and green as accent colours - we want to promote sustainable web therefore we
          must set an example and actually build a <span>low CO2 cost App</span> for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pictures and videos are really CO2 heavy but <span>emojis and SVGs</span> (the cool graphics we use, sag is a picture format) have a much
          lower cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tried to condense all relevant information in as little text and images as possible while still developing a <span>cool app</span>. ‚ôªÔ∏è
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also notice that the information only loads when you demand it form the app. That way we avoid <span>unnecessary loadings</span>{" "}
          and make a greener web together ü•≥
